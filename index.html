# Skillful Notes

## Productive writing with _just_&nbsp;enough&nbsp;complixity

### Ryan Parsley

#### 2024-08-26

???

Let's talk about where your personal notes stop and shared documentation starts.
I've been thinking a bit on how to smoothly transition from one class of writing
to the other and am looking forward to sharing some tips and tricks.

# This is _not_ a presentation about markdown

???

Markdown is great and I believe I use it to great effectin some of the following
examples, but this is not a presentation _about_ markdown. This is a
presentation about thinking and communicating.

It's about selecting the right tool for the job and knowing when adhering to the
tech stack is not a prerequisite.

# A brief history of Markdown

John Gruber made an ergonomic dialect to speed up the writing process for his
static site blog.

It's not his fault developers got a little "too" into the idea.

---

# Does `X` _support_ markdown

Yes, that's the beauty of markdown. Even in the complete absense of "support"
you can still read it just fine. I can write markdown on a piece of paper with a
pen and you can pick up what I'm putting down.

Lack of rich text support in early iPhone created a hole that markdown filled.

Once it was a popular enough defacto standard, devs made support for it better
and better.

# What's the killer feature of Obsidian?

## First place: The community

The Obsidian community is full of thoughtful content creators sharing tips and
tricks.

## Tied for second: Ergonomics and Extensibility

The features I love most about Obsidian were written by a member of the
community.

- dataview
- tracker (habit tracking)
- periodic notes (better than 1st party daily)
- templater (better than 1st partty templates)

# What's the killer feature of any decent editor/ IDE?

???

Ok, so why would a dev _not_ want to trick out thier editor instead of using
Obsidian?

---

# Language Server Protocol (LSP)

- Markdown Oxide
- Marksman

## Features

- follow links
- count references
- complain about dead links

---

# Documentation in your monorepo

---

# But, ADO can't parse that

BYO parsing if you care to

---

# Demo: Bundle Audits from Notes

### Bio

Ryan may be a little _too_ into small sharp tools

### Title/one-liner

Skillful Notes: Productive writing with _just enough_ complexity

### Presentation synopsis

Sometimes simple tools are hard to wield efficiently. I'll share thoughts I'm
developing about using plain text for a richer writing experience.

### Who is your audience?

Anyone interested in getting a richer experience from simple writing tools and
isn't afraid of shell scripts.
