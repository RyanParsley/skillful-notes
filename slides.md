Let's talk about where your personal notes stop and shared documentation starts.
I've been thinking a bit on how to smoothly transition from one class of writing

# This is _not_ a presentation about markdown

???

Markdown is great and I believe I use it to great effectin some of the following
examples, but this is not a presentation _about_ markdown. This is a
presentation about thinking and communicating.

It's about selecting the right tool for the job and knowing when adhering to the
tech stack is not a prerequisite.
