Let's talk about where your personal notes stop and shared documentation starts.
I've been thinking a bit on how to smoothly transition from one class of writing
to the other and am looking forward to sharing some tips and tricks.

# This is _not_ a presentation about markdown

???

Markdown is great and I believe I use it to great effectin some of the following
examples, but this is not a presentation _about_ markdown. This is a
presentation about thinking and communicating.

It's about selecting the right tool for the job and knowing when adhering to the
tech stack is not a prerequisite.

## A brief history of Markdown

John Gruber made an ergonomic dialect to speed up the writing process for his
static site blog.

It's not his fault developers got a little "too" into the idea.

## Does `X` _support_ markdown

Yes, that's the beauty of markdown. Even in the complete absense of "support"
you can still read it just fine. I can write markdown on a piece of paper with a
pen and you can pick up what I'm putting down.

Lack of rich text support in early iPhone created a hole that markdown filled.

Once it was a popular enough defacto standard, devs made support for it better
and better.

## What's the killer feature of Obsidian?

### First place: The community

The Obsidian community is full of thoughtful content creators sharing tips and
tricks.

### Tied for second: Ergonomics and Extensibility

The features I love most about Obsidian were written by a member of the
community.

- dataview
- tracker (habit tracking)
- periodic notes (better than 1st party daily)
- templater (better than 1st partty templates)

## What's the killer feature of any decent editor/ IDE?

Ok, so why would a dev _not_ want to trick out thier editor instead of using
Obsidian?
