Sometimes simple tools are hard to wield efficiently. I'll share thoughts I'm
developing about using plain text for a richer writing experience.

## Usage

Once the deck is spun up, hit `c` to clone an instance for another screen and
`p` to toggle presenter mode.

## Install

```bash
npm i
```

## Serve

```bash
npm start
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Dependencies

This is build with Remark.js and the Remarker CLI.
